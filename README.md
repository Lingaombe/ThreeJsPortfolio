# 🌌 Three.js Portfolio

This is my **first ever portfolio**, built with **Three.js**.
It’s my starting point in combining **web development** with **3D graphics** and experimenting with interactive designs.

## 📂 Features

* ✨ 3D elements and interactions using **Three.js**
* 🎨 Custom design to showcase my projects and skills
* 🖥️ Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js**

## 🚧 Status

Currently, the project is **not deployed**.
You can explore it locally by cloning the repo.

## 🛠 Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lingaombe/ThreeJsPortfolio.git
   cd ThreeJsPortfolio
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   *(For best results, run it with a local server — e.g., VS Code Live Server extension or Python’s `http.server`.)*

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Deploy on **GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel**
